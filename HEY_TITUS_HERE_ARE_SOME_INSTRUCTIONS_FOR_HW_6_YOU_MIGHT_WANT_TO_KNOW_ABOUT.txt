6.1		This is accomplished with server.py in our main directory. An example of it handling a POST
		request can be seen by using the conversion tool. 

6.2		Yeah... we ran out of time.

6.3		We have provided a script (/drinkz/sql_seed_db.py) to seed the database with useful data.
		It would probably be a good idea to run this before starting our server.

6.4		Implemented as requested, can be seen with run-web or server.py. Better with server.py in the main directory.

6.5		Accomplishes the requested task. The "Log-In" button will create a cookie for the client
		and "Log-Out" will clear this cookie. (If we weren't so strapped for time we would have
		made this actually useful; username/password, user feedback, etc.)


Thanks,
Mike and Phil
